# Register App
This application will test your basic knowledge of React as our main frontend stack. The application must run in client-side only, no server-side application required to run the app.

## Instructions
### 1. Create a register page that contains a form for users to register which includes following fields: each field present is worth 5 points
    a. Company to Apply - Dropdown with 4 options populated from React-Redux: "Brewed Delight", "Noah's Coffee", "Royal Coffee", or "Cup of Magic".
    b. Position to Apply - Five checkboxes for our Software Engineer position, consisted of "Backend Developer", "Frontend Developer", "Quality Assurance", "Devops", and "Check All".
    c. Full Name - One input field
    d. Phone Number with +62 prefix - One input field, but the prefix must be OUTSIDE the input field.
    e. Password and Confirm password field with toggle button to show/hide the input - Two input fields, with toggle button at the end of the field.

### 2. Validate the register form upon *user input* NOT *form submission*, the validation must be displayed on each field with following restrictions: Each validator is worth 10 points
    a. Company to Apply - Must be selected to proceed, your code will be checked to determine whether or not the data uses React-Redux to populate.
